## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for detecting anomalies in synthetic network traffic using machine learning models. The primary objective is to identify unusual patterns that may indicate cybersecurity threats by implementing a structured ML pipeline.

## Project Highlights

- Developed a machine learning pipeline in Python using `scikit-learn` to detect anomalies in network traffic.
- Addressed class imbalance using **SMOTE**, improving model sensitivity to rare attack instances.
- Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and better visualization.
- Trained and evaluated **Isolation Forest** and **Random Forest** classifiers.
- Achieved **83% recall** and **63% accuracy** in detecting anomalies.

## Tools & Techniques

- Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib
- SMOTE (imbalanced-learn)
- Random Forest, Isolation Forest
- PCA for feature reduction
- Jupyter Notebook for development and visualization
